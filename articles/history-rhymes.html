                <p><span>In the summer of 1862, America was playing catchup in a world being transformed by the Industrial Revolution. The advent of steel manufacturing and advancements in chemical engineering were </span><strong>automating labor jobs</strong><span> that had been feeding agricultural families for decades.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Abraham Lincoln believed in industry over agriculture. He envisioned the practical application of these new technologies as his ticket to modernizing the national economy. However, Lincoln foresaw there was a </span><strong>piece of the puzzle left unsolved</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You see, America’s backbone at the time was comprised of millions of farming and land-owning families, who saw the industrialization as </span><strong>a threat to their entire livelihood</strong><span> - hell, to their entire Protestant work ethic and way of life (does that sound familiar?)</span></p><p><span>Lincoln believed the government’s responsibility was to the people, not the technology. Therefore, Lincoln swiftly signed </span><strong>three acts in three months</strong><span> that forever transformed our nation between May and July 1862.&nbsp;</span></p><p>First, Lincoln signed into law the Pacific Railway Act, which established a public-private partnership to build a network of Transcontinental Railroads linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Second, Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, which granted a families, </span><strong>free of charge</strong><span>, 160 acres of government land in the Western Territories with the option to purchase that land at a discounted price in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Third, Lincoln signed the Morrill Act, which established the first system of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Land-Grant_Acts#/media/File:Land_Grant_Colleges_Map.svg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">land-grant colleges</a><span> across existing and new territories, which educated children of settlement families on the recent advancements in agricultural science and machinery .&nbsp;</span></p><p>So in other words, how did Lincoln handle the automation of jobs brought about by technology?</p><p><span>First he gave agricultural families an incentive to </span><strong>start over</strong><span>. Then, he built an </span><strong>educational system </strong><span>to train their children on the latest technology. Finally, he subsidized a large civil engineering project to </span><strong>employ millions</strong><span> of people using these new technologies.</span></p><p>The results? Within 50 years, the United States was graduating 3000 engineers per year to become the world leader in technical education with groundbreaking inventions releasing each decade.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The system of land-grant colleges combined with the supportive network of family settlements enabled American engineers to work on civil projects that </span><strong>transformed</strong><span> the way people ate, slept, breathed, and communicated with each other.</span></p><p><span>So what about 2020? We know the </span><strong>technological revolution</strong><span> of software, AI and bioinformatics has begun. #COVID-19 is decentralizing access to technology. We also know there is an </span><strong>immense gap</strong><span> between the urban and rural communities in America, evidenced by the 2020 election.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We can take a lesson out of Lincoln’s playbook in order to solve 21st century job automation. We must build the systems to </span><strong>modernize a workforce fueled by the morals that make us one nation, not two.&nbsp;</strong></p>
